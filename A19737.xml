            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </list> Theſe three: The Inſtrument: The end for which: The partie to whom. Now, (to marſhal theſe in their right order,)
<list>
                  <item>1. The end is to be firſt: <hi>Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens ſemper incipit á ſine</hi> (ſaith the Philoſopher.) A wiſe man begins euer at the end: for that indeed, is <hi>Cauſa cauſarum</hi> (as Logique teacheth vs:) The cauſe of all the cauſes; the cauſe that ſets them all on working.</item>
                  <item>2. Then next, the Inſtrument, which applyeth this power to this end.</item>
                  <item>3. And ſo laſt, the Agent, who is to guide the Inſtrument, and to whomeboth Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Power is committed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The end for which this Power is conueied, is double; as the ſubiect is double, wheron it hath his operation: The Campe, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. On either of theſe, a ſpeciall act ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed: To remoue the Campe: to call together the Congregation: One for Warre, the other for Peace.</p>
            <p>That of the Camp, hath no longer vſe, then while it is warre. God forbid that ſhould be long: nay, God forbid it ſhould be at all. The beſt remouing of the Campe, is the remouing of it quite &amp; cleane away. But <hi>if it be not poſſible,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:288:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>if it lye not in vs to haue peace with all men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.18.</note> if warre muſt be, here is order for it. But the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Congregation, that is it: that is to continue, and therefore, that, which we to deale with.</p>
            <p>The calling of the Congregation, (as in the two next verſes) either in whole, or in part; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the Tribes, or but of the chiefe and principal men in them. A power for both theſe: And (in a word) a power generall, for calling Aſſemblies: Aſſemblies in warre: Aſſemblies in peace: Aſſemblies of the whole: Aſſemblies of each, or any part.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Power, to bee executed by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; The Inſtruments to be Trumpets: Two in number: Thoſe to be of ſiluer, and both of one entire piece of ſiluer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This power, and the executing of it by theſe Inſtruments, committed to <hi>Moſes:</hi> Firſt; he to haue the making of theſe Trumpets: <hi>Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibi:</hi> Then, he to haue the right to them being made: <hi>Eterunt tibi:</hi> Then, he to vſe them to call the Congregation, and, if need be, to remooue the Campe. None to make any Trumpet but he. None to haue any Trumpet but he. None to meddle with the calling of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:288:5"/>or remoouing the Campe with them but he, or by his leaue and appointment.</p>
            <p>Wherein as we find the Grant ful; ſo are we further to ſearch and ſee, Whether this Grant tooke place or no? Whether as theſe Trumpets were made &amp; giuen to call the Congregation, ſo the Congregation from time to time, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> haue bin called by theſe trumpets. And ſo firſt of the granting this Power to be executed, and then of the executing this Power ſo graunted.</p>
            <p>So haue we two ſubiects: The Campe, and the Congregation. Two acts: to Aſſemble, and to Remoue. Two Inſtruments: the two ſiluer Trumpets. Two Powers, to make them: To owe them being made, for the two acts or ends before ſpecified: Firſt, for calling the Aſſembly, and then for diſlodging the Campe. And all theſe committed to <hi>Moſes.</hi> The ſumme of all is: the eſtabliſhing in <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prerogatiue and Power, of calling and diſſoluing Aſſemblies about publique affaires.</p>

                  </list> Brieflie thus: the congregation muſt come when it is called: and it muſt be called yet it come. Theſe are the two dueties wee owe to the two trumpets, and both theſe haue Gods people euer duely performed.</p>
               <p>And yet not ſo, but that this Right hath bin called in queſtion, yea, euen in <hi>Moſes</hi> own time,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:288:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>(that we marueile not, if it be ſo now) and both theſe dueties denied him, euen by thoſe who were aliue and preſent then, when God gaue him the trumpets. But marke by whom, and what became of them.</p>
               <p>The firſt duty is, To come when they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: and this was denied (in the 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 12. <hi>ver.</hi>) by <hi>Core, Dathan</hi> &amp; their crew:<note place="margin">1. To come when they be called.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> ſounded his trumpet, ſent to call them: they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere flatly, and that not once, but once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Non veniemus,</hi> They would not come, not once ſtirre for him or his trumpet, they. A plaine contradiction indeed: neither is there in all that <hi>Chapter</hi> any contradiction <hi>veri nominis,</hi> true and properly ſo to be called, but only that. You know what became of them; they went quick to hell for it: and wo be to them, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell (ſaith <hi>S. Iude</hi>) that periſh in the ſame contradiction,<note place="margin">Iude 11.</note> the contradiction of <hi>Core.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond duety is, To bee called yer they come: this likewiſe denied,<note place="margin">2. To be called yer they come.</note> euen <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe (that they in his place may not thinke ſtrange of it) In the 20. <hi>Chapter</hi> of this very booke: Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waxing skant, a company of them grew mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous, and in tumultuous maner, without any ſound of the Trumpet, aſſembled of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:288:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>But theſe are branded too: The water they got, is called the water of <hi>Meriba:</hi> And what followed you know;<note place="margin">Cap. 20.13.</note> None of them that drunke of it, came into the Land of Promiſe. God ſwore they ſhould not enter into his reſt.</p>
               <p>Now, as both theſe are bad: ſo of the twaine, this later is the worſe:<note place="margin">Called, and came not.</note> The former (that came not, beeing called) doe but ſit ſtill, as if they were ſomewhat thicke of hearing: But theſe later that come,<note place="margin">Came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called.</note> being not called; either, they make themſelues a trumpet, without euer a <hi>fac tibi:</hi> or elſe they offer to wring <hi>Moſes</hi> trumpet out of his hands, and take it into their owne. Take heed of this later: it is ſaid there to be <hi>aduerſus Moſen,</hi> euen againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe. It is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next forerunner to it: it prickes faſt vpon it. For they that meete againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> will, when they haue once throughly learned that leſſon, will quickly perhaps grow capable of another; euen to meete againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe, as theſe did.<note place="margin">Acts 19.40.</note> 
                  <hi>Periclitamur argui ſeditionis</hi> (ſaith the Towne-clearke,) We haue done more then we can well anſwere: We may be indicted of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this dayes worke, for comming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without a trumpet: and yet it was for <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> that is, for a matter of Religion.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:288:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>You ſee then whoſe the Right is, and what the dueties be to it, and in whoſe ſteps they tread, that deny them. Sure they haue bene baptized or made to drinke of the ſame water (the water of <hi>Meriba</hi>) that euer ſhal offer, to do the like, to draw together without <hi>Moſes</hi> Call.</p>
               <p>And now to our Sauiour Chriſts queſtion: <hi>In the Law how is it written? How reade you?</hi> Our anſwere is: There it is thus written: and thus wee reade: That <hi>Moſes</hi> hath the Right of the Trumpets: that they to goe euer with him and his ſucceſſors: and that to them belongeth the power of calling the publike Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Agreeable to the Law of Nature.</note>This is the Law of God; and that no iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law, peculiar to that people alone, but agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law of Nature and Nations; (two Lawes of force through the whole world) For euen in the little Empire of the body naturall, <hi>Principium motus,</hi> the beginning of al motion, is in, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head.

               <p>Verily the Heathen lawes made all ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies vnlawful, which the higheſt authority did not cauſe to meete, yea, though they were <gap reason="foreign">

But I let them paſſe, and ſtand onely on the written Law, the Law of God.</p>
               <p>WE haue Law then for vs, That <hi>Moſes</hi> is euer to call the Congregation. But though we haue Law, <hi>Mos vincit Legem;</hi> Cuſtome ouerru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

Had the Prieſts, without him, beene poſſeſſed of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Aſſembling, how had any Acte concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Religion paſſed without them? In them it had beene to ſtoppe it at any time, if they had (of themſelues) had this power of Aſſembling themſelues, to ſet order in matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>Thus, from <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> wee ſee in whoſe hands this power was. And what ſhould I ſay more? There was in all Gods people no one religious King, but this Power he practiſed: And there was of all Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets no one, that euer interpoſed any prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition againſt it.</p>
               <p>Would <hi>Eſay</hi> (ſhall we once imagine) haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured <hi>Ezekias,</hi> him to cal, or the Prieſts to come

Neuer certainely.</p>
               <p>What ſhall wee ſay then? were all theſe wrong? ſhall wee condemne them all? Take heed. In all that gouernment, God hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther children,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.15.</note> but theſe: if we condemne theſe, we condemne the whole generation of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

Yea, thoſe foure firſt, which all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue euer had in ſo great reuerence, and high eſtimation; not one of them a lawfull Councell, if this new aſſertion take place. This is a perillous inconuenience: yet this we muſt yeeld to, and more then this; if we ſeeke to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Aſſemblies, ſo holden. For ſure it is, all the Generall Councels were thus Aſſembled; all; all ſeuen (for more are not to bee reckoned:) the eight was only for a priuate buſineſſe. The reſt were only of the Weſt Church alone, and ſo not generall: The Eaſt and Weſt together, make a generall: The Eaſt and Weſt together neuer met, but in one of thoſe ſeuen, for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affaires: vnleſſe it were once after, in that of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> And it is well knowen, that was in hope of helpe, on the Eaſt Churches part, which they neuer had; and ſo the Councell neuer kept, but broken, euen as ſoone as it was broken vp.</p>
               <p>Briefly then to ſuruey thoſe ſeuen. And I will not therein alledge the reports of Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, (they write things they ſaw not, many times, and ſo frame matters to their owne
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:288:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>conceits: and many times are taynted with a partiall humour) but only out of authenticall Records in them, and out of the very actes of the Councels themſelues, beſt able to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and tell, by whoſe authoritie they came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And it is happy for the Church of Chriſt, there are ſo many of them extant as there are, to guide vs to the trueth in this poynt, that ſo the right may appeare.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, for the great Nicene Councel, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the firſt Generall Congregation of all that were called in the Chriſtian world: The whole Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The whole Letter is extant vpon record in <hi>Socr.</hi> 1.9. and <hi>Theodoret.</hi> 1.9. Giue mee leaue to make here a little ſtand: For heere, at this Councell, was the pale firſt broken, and the right (if any ſuch were) here, it went firſt away. At Nice there were then together, 318. Biſhops, <hi>totius orbis lumina</hi> (as <hi>Victorinus</hi> well termeth them) the lights of the whole world; the chiefeſt and choiſeſt men for holineſſe, learning, vertue, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:288:19"/>that the Chriſtian Religion euer had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or ſince; men that had layd downe their liues for the teſtimony of the trueth. Did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them refuſe to come, being called by him, as not called aright? Or, comming, was there any one of them that did proteſt againſt it? or pleaded the Churches intereſt, to meete or themſelues? Not one.</p>
               <p>What was it then? want of skill, in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny famous men, that knew not their owne rights? Or want of valure, that knowing it for ſuch, would not ſo much as ſpeake a word for it, but ſit ſtill, and ſay nothing all the while? There were then and there preſent, <hi>Spyridion, Paphnutius Potamon,</hi> and diuers beſides, (but theſe I name) that had not long before, for their conſtancie, had their right eyes bored out, their right hame-ſtrings, and the ſtrings of their right-armpits cut in ſunder. Did theſe want courage, thinke wee? Were they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo ſaint hearted, that they durſt not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their mouth, for their owne due?</p>
               <p>Verily, that Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> (which is and euer hath beene ſo much admired by all Chriſtians,) cannot be excuſed before God or men; if they thus conſpired all, to betray
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:288:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Churches right, and ſuffered it, contrary to all equitie, to bee carried away; leauing a dangerous precedent therein, for all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels euer after, to the worlds end. But, no ſuch right there was: If there had beene, they neither wanted wit to diſcerne it, nor courage to claime it. But, they knew whoſe the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets were: To whom <hi>(Erunt tibi)</hi> was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and therefore neuer offered to lay hold on either of them, and ſay; This is ours.</p>
               <p>And yet (to ſay the trueth,) There is no man of reaſon, but will thinke it reaſonable, if this were the Churches owne peculiar, if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriat vnto it, (and ſo knowen to them to be) there ought to haue beene plaine dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, now at the very firſt Councell of all; that if <hi>Conſtantine</hi> would embrace Religion, hee muſt needs reſigne vp one of his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and forbeare from thence to meddle with their Aſſemblies. Was there ſo? No ſuch thing. Why was there not? Belike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none were there, that had euer beene preſent at any Aſſembly, holden vnder perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, to know the Churches order, and manner of meeting then. Yes, there was <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuis</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cordoua,</hi> who had held the

But when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> came in place, in <hi>Moſes</hi> place, it was lawfull for him to doe as <hi>Moſes</hi> did: And ſo he did; and they neuer ſayd to him, Nay, ſpare your Trumpet: looke how wee haue done hitherto, we will do ſo euen ſtill: meet no otherwiſe now, then in former times wee haue; by our own agreement. As before it was ſayd, this had beene plaine dealing: Thus (if rightly they might) they ſhould haue

No: But to him they went, as to <hi>Moſes</hi> for their meetings; at his hands they ſought them; without his leaue or liking they would not attempt them: yea (I dare ſay) they bleſſed God from their heartes, that they had liued to ſee the day, they might now aſſemble by the ſound of the Trumpet.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point then. Theſe two times or eſtates of the Church are not to bee confounded: There is a plaine difference betweene them, and a diuerſe reſpect to bee had of each.
